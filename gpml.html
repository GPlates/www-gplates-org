			<h2>What is GPML?</h2>
			<hr size="4" />

			<p>
				<b>GPML</b> is the <em>GPlates Markup Language</em>, the &ldquo;native&rdquo;
				file format of GPlates.  GPML is custom-designed for geological and geographic
				data in a plate-tectonics context.  At this time, GPML is the only file format
				capable of representing all the various types of current and next-generation
				data used in GPlates for <a href="features.html"
				 title="Find out what GPlates can do">next-generation plate-tectonics
				research</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				GPML is an XML-based language for plate-tectonics data, just as <a
				 href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml/" title="KML | OGC">KML</a>
				(used by <a href="http://maps.google.com/" title="Google Maps">Google Maps</a>
				and <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="Google Earth">Google Earth</a>)
				is an XML-based language for geographic annotations.  In the future, GPlates
				will offer the ability to export geographic snapshots as KML.
			</p>

			<h2>How is GPML defined?</h2>
			<hr size="4" />

			<p>
				GPML is defined by the <b>GPGIM</b>, the <em><a
				 href="http://www.earthbyte.org/Resources/GPGIM/"
				 title="EarthByte: GPlates Geological Information Model">GPlates Geological
				Information Model</a></em>, an application schema of <a
				 href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml"
				 title="OGC: Geography Markup Language">GML</a> which specifies and describes:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					the geological, geographic and tectonic entities which GPlates simulates
				</li>

				<li>
					the conceptual building-blocks which GPlates defines
				</li>

				<li>
					the processing and simulation constraints to which GPlates adheres.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The <a href="contact.html" title="Contact the developers of GPlates">GPlates
				software developers</a> have worked closely with the scientists to create,
				refine and evolve the GPGIM specification over time, since this
				document both specifies formally what the programmers need to implement in the
				GPlates software, and defines the geological terminology in precise modelling
				terms, to enable the scientists and software developers to communicate most
				effectively using a shared vocabulary.
			</p>

			<h2>Why use GPML?</h2>
			<hr size="4" />

			<p>
				When geological features or reconstruction poles are loaded in GPlates, the
				data are contained in GPlates as <a
				 href="http://www.earthbyte.org/Resources/GPGIM/public/"
				 title="Browse the GPGIM feature catalogue">GPGIM features</a>.  Since the
				structure of GPML corresponds to the GPGIM, GPML is the closest representation
				to the internal data representation of GPlates.  Saving your GPlates data in
				GPML ensures that no information will be lost due to file format limitations or
				incompatibilities.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since GPML is an XML format, it is more easily understood by other software,
				and the XML structure of a GPML file may be validated automatically by
				XML-validating software.  However, the downside to XML is that it can be quite
				verbose, so general-purpose GPML files are usually larger than special-purpose
				proprietary formats like the <span
				 style="font-variant: small-caps">Plates4</span> and ESRI Shapefile formats. 
				For this reason, GPlates also offers the <b>compressed GPML</b> format, which
				is GPML compressed by the open-source <a href="http://www.gzip.org/"
				 title="The gzip home page">gzip</a> program.  A compressed GPML file can be up
				to 1/30th the size of the corresponding regular GPML file, and approximately
				60% of the size of the equivalent <span
				 style="font-variant: small-caps">Plates4</span> file!
