			A few points to note regarding this release:-
			<ul>
				<li>The Sample Data includes the Matthews et al. (2016) model, which has been updated to include the corrections to the Pacific rotations prior to 83 Ma according to Torsvik et al. (2019). <b>Please update your local datasets.</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Matthews, K. J., Maloney, K. T., Zahirovic, S., Williams, S. E., Seton, M., and MÃ¼ller, R. D., 2016, Global plate boundary evolution and kinematics since the late Paleozoic: Global and Planetary Change, DOI: 10.1016/j.gloplacha.2016.10.002</li>
						<li>Torsvik, T.H., Steinberger, B., Shephard, G.E., Doubrovine, P.V., Gaina, C., Domeier, M., Conrad, C.P. and Sager, W.W., 2019. Pacific-Panthalassic reconstructions: Overview, errata and the way forward. Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, DOI:10.1029/2019GC008402</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>There is now a 64-bit version of GPlates for Windows:
					<ul>
						<li>The 64-bit Windows installer works on 64-bit versions of Windows 7/8/8.1/10.</li>
						<li>The 32-bit Windows installer works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 7/8/8.1/10.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Currently there are some issues with 3D scalar fields on macOS Mojave (10.14) and above:
					<ul>
						<li>This happens on some Macs with AMD graphics (specifically we've noticed AMD Radeon Pro 460).</li>
						<li>3D scalar fields render incorrectly and then crash in the graphics driver.</li>
						<li>Note that disabling automatic GPU switching does not help, since this always uses the discrete graphics (eg, AMD) and not the integrated graphics (eg, Intel HD).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Also, the first time you open GPlates on macOS 10.12 Sierra (and above) you will need to Control-click (or right click) and select Open.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
			What's new in GPlates 2.2:-
			<ul>
				<li>Deformation:
					<ul>
						<li>Option to generate 'exponential' stretching profiles across rifts (instead of default constant stretching).
							<ul>
								<li>Activated by adding 'rift' left/right plate IDs to any deforming network.</li>
								<li>Optionally specify three control parameters:
									<ul>
										<li>One parameter controls the exponential constant.</li>
										<li>The other two parameters control how closely to approximate exponential curve (with better approximations running slower).</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Calculate, visualize and export strain rate "style":
							<ul>
								<li>A unit-less quantity defined in Kreemer et al. 2014, categorizing extension, contraction and strike-slip.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Support deforming networks in Net Rotation export (in addition to rigid plates).</li>
						<li>Option to generate deforming mesh points inside interior rigid blocks in deforming networks.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Topologies:
					<ul>
						<li>Updated CitcomS topology export:
							<ul>
								<li>Option to export all (plate/network/slab) polygons and all (plate/network/slab) boundary segments.</li>
								<li>Fixed missing plates (that were not of type TopologicalClosedPlateBoundary; eg, OceanicCrust).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Updated General topology export:
							<ul>
								<li>Option to export boundary segments.
									<ul>
										<li>Including separate subduction, subduction left/right, ridge/transform files (similar to CitcomS topology export).</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Boundary segments are not duplicated.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Robust determination of velocities along topological boundaries (of rigid plates and deforming networks):
							<ul>
								<li>Notably in the presence of deforming *lines* (eg, topological lines made from independently moving points).</li>
								<li>Results in robust strain rates in topological networks (especially at intersecting boundary corners).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Projects and recent sessions:
					<ul>
						<li>Save time slider range to project/session.
							<ul>
								<li>Also extend default time range to 410Ma (from 200Ma) for rotation model in sample data.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>File formats:
					<ul>
						<li>Can load/save GeoPackage geometry files.</li>
						<li>All non-GPML geometry formats (Shapefile, etc) no longer force a feature to have all mapped properties:
							<ul>
								<li>Avoids adding a property to a feature that it didn't have (eg, conjugate plate ID).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Support UTF8 when loading (and saving) PLATES4 line and rotation formats.
							<ul>
								<li>Useful when rotation comments contain non-ASCII characters.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Rendering:
					<ul>
						<li>Can show/hide rasters, 3D scalar fields and scalar coverages.
							<ul>
								<li>In "View > Geometry Visibility" menu.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Can show/hide topological lines, polygons and networks (in same menu).
							<ul>
								<li>Can also show/hide topological 'sections' (those geometries contributing to topological boundaries/interiors).
									<ul>
										<li>So only see final continuously-closed topological boundaries.</li>
									</ul>
								<li>GPlates now hides these dangling pieces by default (advanced users can change the default though).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Velocity layers can calculate/visualize velocities on *domains* that are topology layers (as opposed to *surfaces*).
							<ul>
								<li>At the *vertices* of topological lines, polygons and networks.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Render clicked (white) geometries on top of non-clicked (grey) geometries (belonging to the same feature).
							<ul>
								<li>Useful when the feature's geometries overlap.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>GPlates Geological Information Model (GPGIM):
					<ul>
						<li>Added new GPGIM feature type 'DeformingRegionEdge' that is edge of a deforming region but not also a plate boundary.</li>
						<li>Allow MeshNode feature to contain a point geometry (previously only allowed a multi-point).
							<ul>
								<li>Enables single point to automatically create a velocity layer (because only MeshNode features do this).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Added properties for rift exponential stretching:
							<ul>
								<li>'riftLeftPlate' and 'riftRightPlate' - conjugate rigid plates bounding a rift topological network.</li>
								<li>'riftExponentialStretchingConstant' - controls exponential variation across rift stretching profile.</li>
								<li>'riftEdgeLengthThresholdDegrees' and 'riftStrainRateResolutionLog10' - control approximation to true exponential curve.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Removed topological network properties 'networkMaxEdge' and 'networkShapeFactor' (no longer used).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Geometry tests:
					<ul>
						<li>Assigning plate IDs is much faster (especially dense geometries like coastlines).</li>
						<li>Robust polyline intersection testing, and significantly faster.</li>
						<li>Distances to polygons (from another geometry) now take into account any interior rings of the polygon.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Bug fixes:
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed hang on start up on some Mac systems (where network interface appears active but network is unavailable).</li>
						<li>Fixed time-dependent raster import (and 3D scalar field import) not accepting filenames with uppercase extensions.</li>
						<li>Fixed crash triggered when exporting total strains.</li>
						<li>Fixed crash when exiting GPlates on some Ubuntu versions (due to freeing same memory twice).</li>
						<li>Fixed crash when saving a rotation feature with a 'gml:name' or 'gml:description' property to a PLATES4 rotation file.</li>
						<li>Fix crash loading a GPML file containing a feature property that cannot be interpreted using any property defined in the GPGIM.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Build:
					<ul>
						<li>Support Visual Studio 2015/2017 (GDAL 2.3 uses C++11 which requires VS2015), and update Windows build docs accordingly.</li>
						<li>Fixed incorrect 90 degree rotation of rasters with inbuilt projections (eg, Lambert Conformal Conic) when GPlates compiled with GDAL 3.0.</li>
						<li>Upgraded support to new Proj6 API (also support deprecated Proj4 API).</li>
						<li>Added SQLite3 dependency library (due to adding support for GeoPackage vector format).</li>
						<li>Support Boost 1.66 (added x32/x64 architecture tags) and Boost 1.67 (added Python version suffix 'python27').</li>
						<li>Fixed CMake error finding GMP library on Windows (recent CGAL versions already link to GMP, so GPlates doesn't need to).</li>
						<li>Work around internal compiler error (gcc 5.4) on Ubuntu Xenial (16.04).</li>
						<li>No longer combine '-ansi' (equivalent to '-std=c++98') and '-std=c++11' flags (first noticed on gcc 9.1).</li>
						<li>No longer turn warnings into errors:
							<ul>
								<li>There are lots of warnings generated by dependency libraries (that we can't easily fix), and by new compilers.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

						<li>Time-dependent raster (and 3D scalar field) import now supports times (depths) anywhere in filenames.
							<ul>
								<li>For ambiguous cases (eg, multiple decimal points) place times (depths) at end of filename (after '_' or '-').</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Fixed incorrect half-pixel shift downwards (North to South) for *gridline* registered global GMT grids.

						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Digitization:
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed vertex edits not modifying topologies.
							<ul>
								<li>Eg, moving vertices of a feature used as a topological section in a topological network.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Digitize New Geometries:
							<ul>
								<li>No longer offer Reconstruction/Conjugate Plate IDs for topological networks and topological lines.

						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Geometry tests:
					<ul>
						<li>Point-in-polygon test now considers points *on* a polygon edge (within extremely small tolerance) to be inside polygon.
							<ul>
								<li>Helps ensure points lying exactly on dateline are inside a polygon that has an edge exactly aligned with dateline.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Fixed Assign Plate IDs retaining only first geometry in each feature when using 'copy by overlap'.</li>
						<li>Fixed point proximity to a polyline/polygon in rare situations.
							<ul>
								<li>Resulted in incorrect selection with Choose Feature tool.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Topology tools:
					<ul>
						<li>Build topology tools are now always enabled (makes it easier to build topologies at any time).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>GPlates Geological Information Model (GPGIM):
					<ul>
						<li>Loosen constraints on properties that can be loaded from a GPML file.
							<ul>
								<li>Any feature type can now contain any property defined in the GPGIM.</li>
								<li>Can have feature types not defined in GPGIM.</li>
								<li>More aligned with current ability to add any property to any feature type (albeit with a warning message).</li>
								<li>Also more aligned with Shapefiles (which can load any property, in Shapefile mapping, into any feature type).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Allow multiple 'gpml:boundary' polygons per feature.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Graphics (OpenGL):
					<ul>
						<li>Only disable surface mask functionality in 3D scalar fields for problematic graphics driver/hardware.
							<ul>
								<li>Only affects surface masking of scalar fields (not all scalar field functionality).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Support up to 10-digit plate IDs (essentially 32-bit signed integers) in all Plate ID spin boxes.</li>
				<li>Fixed inability to save PLATES rotation files using non-ASCII (unicode) filenames (in some cases).</li>
				<li>Fixed inability to save/load OGR formats (eg, Shapefile) to/from non-ASCII (unicode) filenames.</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Deformation:
					<ul>
						<li>Topological networks:
							<ul>
								<li>Boundary is similar to a topological closed plate boundary, but also has:

			<p>Congratulations to GPlates team on winning this year's NeCTAR/ANDS #nadojo competition. The award-winning work demonstrated a new web-enabled GPlates prototype on the NECTAR/ANDS eResearch computing infrastructure, porting some of the powerful plate reconstruction capabilities to the web. The new GPlates competed with several other candidates from universities and research institutes in Australia, and winning on the basis of the novelty and future potential. A judge was quoted as saying:
					"...being able to look at tectonic plates and how they move over 140Ma years ago brought me back to that child-like awe of wonder and amazement, like the first time you look up at the stars and realise how many (light?) years away they are..."

					Well done GPlates team!</p>

			This release is a preview of raster reconstructions and layers. 
			We have implemented raster reconstructions to take advantage of 
			the majority of graphics systems so please let us know if you are 
			having difficulty on your system.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you want to reconstruct a raster, and try out the new layers system, the sample data 
			in this release contains the following files to demonstrate this: 
			<ul>
			 <li>
				present-day plate polygons (in <code>SampleData/FeatureCollections/StaticPolygons/</code>) 
			   - <code>Global_Earthbyte_GPlates_PresentDay_PlatePolygons_20100826.gpml</code>, 
			 </li>
			 <li>
			   a rotation file (in <code>SampleData/FeatureCollections/Rotations/</code>) 
			   - <code>Global_Earthbyte_GPlates_Rotation_20091015.rot</code>, 
			 </li>
			 <li>
			   a global marine gravity raster (in <code>SampleData/Rasters/</code>) 
			   - <code>DNSC08GRA_6m.gpml</code>, 
			 </li>
			 <li>
			   an ocean-floor age grid (in <code>SampleData/Rasters/</code>) 
			   - <code>agegrid_6m.gpml</code>. 
			 </li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			To reconstruct the above gravity raster load all the above files into GPlates 
			using "Open Feature Collection" from the "File" menu. And then connect the 
			present-day plate polygons to the "Polygon features" input channel of the 
			gravity raster. The gravity raster should now reconstruct. 
			</p>
			<p>
			For a high-detail reconstruction you can also connect the age grid raster 
			to the "Age grid feature" input channel of the gravity raster. 
			</p>

			Changes since 0.9.7.1:
			</p>
			 
			<ul>

			<li>
			The new 0.9.8 release of GPlates can use a loaded topological plate polygon data set to "<strong>cookie-cut</strong>" a feature collection
			and <strong>assign Plate IDs</strong> to the data based on which plate polygon intersects them. This enables users to load data
			files that do not have Plate ID or reconstruction time information, and then manipulate that data with the
			loaded reconstruction model.
			</li>

			<li>
			<div>
				Support for <strong>virtual geomagnetic pole data</strong> is ongoing. As a special preview of GPlates paleo-mag functionality,
			GPlates is now able to import data from the <strong>IAGA Global Paleomagnetic
			Database</strong> created by Mike McElhinny and Jo Lock, later maintained by Sergei
			Pisarevsky. GPlates can then assign Plate IDs from a topological plate polygon data set and
			then display the reconstructed virtual geomagnetic pole locations on the
			globe. The database is available online here: <a href="http://www.ngu.no/geodynamics/gpmdb/">http://www.ngu.no/geodynamics/gpmdb/</a>
			</div>
			<div>
			In future releases, full editing capabilities and support for a wide range of data (such as the
			<a href="http://earthref.org/MAGIC/" title="The Magnetics Information Consortium database at earthref.org">MagIC</a> database) will be forthcoming.
			</div>
			</li>

			<li>
			<strong>Small circle arcs</strong> can be rendered by GPlates to indicate the error bounds of virtual geomagnetic poles.
			</li>

			<li>
			Development on new colouring options has started. GPlates' default Plate ID colouring scheme has been tweaked, and a
			<strong>new colour by Plate ID region</strong> colouring scheme has been created.
			</li>

			<li>
			The Modify Reconstruction Pole tool can now <strong>constrain the latitude</strong> of the pole manipulation while
			interactively making adjustments.
			</li>

			<li>
			The topological capabilities of GPlates are undergoing constant improvement and expansion. As a consequence of these
			ongoing developments, GPlates now links with <a href="http://www.cgal.org/" title="CGAL - Computational Geometry Algorithms Library">CGAL</a>,
			the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library. This will enable many impressive extensions to the topology tools in the future.
			</li>

			Changes since 0.9.5:
			</p>
			 
			<ul>

			<li>
			GPlates can now utilise a <strong>full screen mode</strong>, which is available by pressing <strong>F11</strong>.
			This mode is ideal for presenting data and animations using GPlates.
			It makes the user interface more minimalistic, granting a greater amount of screen space
			to the main view. This is especially useful on low-resolution devices such as projectors.
			</li>

			<li>
			A new <strong>Measure Distance Tool</strong> has been implemented, allowing precise measurement
			of the distance between any two chosen points. It also interacts with the digitisation and
			feature-selecting tools, to enable easy inspection of the distances along polyline geometries
			and polyline segments.
			</li>

			<li>
			Exporting the Total Reconstruction Poles table to CSV can now be done with a choice of delimiters,
			and more closely adheres to the CSV specifications.
			</li>

			<li>
			The previous 0.9.6 release involved the <strong>integration of the plate polygon closure workflow</strong> into
			the main stable branch of GPlates. With 0.9.7.1, additional work has gone into improving
			the user experience and making the topology algorithms more intelligent, and enables the <strong>export
			of geometry sub-segments</strong> involved in topologies.

			<p>
			The massive <strong>GPlates 0.9.5</strong> release in fact consists of two
			simultaneous software releases:
			</p>

			<ul>
			<li>the &ldquo;official&rdquo; release of the GPlates &ldquo;stable
			mainline&rdquo; (like all previous 0.9.x releases), named
			<i>GPlates&nbsp;0.9.5</i></li>
			<li>the &ldquo;testing&rdquo; release of the widely-anticipated extension
			functionality for continuously-closing plates and lithosphere velocity fields
			which was developed primarily <a href="contact.html"
			 title="Contact the developers of GPlates">at CalTech</a>, named
			<i>GPlates&nbsp;0.9.5&nbsp;+&nbsp;platepolygon-testing</i>.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
			The GPlates 0.9.5 release features the following changes since 0.9.4:
			</p>
			 
			<ul>

			<li>
			GPlates can now <strong>export feature data</strong> in the
			<strong>Shapefile</strong> format.  (This complements the existing ability to
			import Shapefiles <em>into</em> GPlates as feature data.)
			</li>

			<li>
			Additionally, GPlates can now <strong>export</strong>
			&ldquo;<strong>reconstructed geometries</strong>&rdquo; (feature geometries at
			a particular reconstruction time in the past) in both the
			<strong>Shapefile</strong> and <strong>GMT</strong> formats.
			</li>

			<li>
			GPlates is now able to display the Earth in a variety of <strong>map
			projections</strong> (in addition to the existing 3-D Orthographic Globe
			projection):
			<ul>
			<li>Rectangular</li>
			<li>Mercator</li>
			<li>Mollweide</li>
			<li>Robinson</li>
			</ul>
			As was possible with the existing 3-D Orthographic Globe projection, each of
			these map-projections can be exported as a <strong>2-D geometry
			snapshot</strong> (a 2-D vector-graphics image in the SVG format), for later
			viewing in a web-browser or vector-graphics editor.
			</li>

			<li>
			The advanced functionality of the new <strong>Export Animation</strong> dialog
			enables you to harness the power of the GPlates reconstruction engine to create
			your own &ldquo;<strong>data animations</strong>&rdquo;, exporting a sequence
			of frames from an animation and saving it to disk in a sequence of files. 
			Currently, the Export Animation dialog offers the following export functions:
			<ul>
			<li>all reconstructed feature geometries (as GMT .xy files or Shapefiles)</li>
			<li>a 2-D vector graphics snapshot of the view (as SVG files)</li>
			<li>all velocity fields (as GPML files)</li>
			</ul>
			More export functions will be added in the future.
			</li>

			<li>
			The GPlates main window has enjoyed a minor re-design of its layout, to improve
			the locality of the controls:  Now the reconstruction-time controls are
			together above the reconstruction view, and the view controls (zoom, choice of
			map projection, and camera and mouse positions) are together <em>below</em> the
			reconstruction view.  This re-design allowed us to incorporate an integrated
			<strong>animation time-slider</strong> in with the time controls.
			</li>

			<li>
			GPlates is now released as a <strong>MacOS X binary bundle</strong> in a
			<code>.dmg</code> file (in addition to the existing Windows binary installer
			and the Linux/UNIX and Windows source-code packages).  To install GPlates on
			MacOS X, simply:
			<ol>
			<li>double-click on the <code>.dmg</code> file to open the disk image in
			Finder,</li>
			<li>drag the GPlates binary into your Applications folder.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>

			<li>
			It's now even easier than before to manipulate geometries interactively.  When
			you're deciding which vertex you want to move using the <strong>Move
			Vertex</strong> tool, each vertex will <strong>light up</strong> yellow when
			you pass the mouse pointer over it, and the coordinates of the vertex also
			light up yellow in the Task Panel.  You can move vertices of existing feature
			geometries or vertices of partially-digitised geometries.
			</li>

			<li>
			You can now <strong>insert vertices</strong> into the middle of an existing
			feature geometry, or even <strong>extend</strong> the feature geometry
			at either end, using the new <strong>Insert Vertex</strong> tool.  If the mouse
			pointer is over a line-section of the geometry, the line-section will light up,
			and you can click the mouse button once to insert a new vertex.  If the mouse
			pointer is past either end of the geometry, you can click once to extend the
			geometry from that end.
			</li>

			<li>
			You can also <strong>delete a vertex</strong> from a geometry using the new
			<strong>Delete Vertex</strong> tool.  The geometry which will be deleted will
			<strong>light up red</strong>, and the coordinates of the geometry will also
			light up red in the Task Panel.
			</li>

			<li>
			GPlates offers Better handling of multi-geometries (multiple-geometries per
			feature): both in the loading and saving of files; and in the feature focus
			and canvas tools in the user-interface.
			</li>

			<li>
			The <strong><a href="docs.html"
			 title="Read the user-manual and other GPlates documentation">official GPlates
			user-manual</a></strong> is now online!
			</li>

			</ul>

			<p>
			The <i>GPlates&nbsp;0.9.5 + platepolygon-testing</i> release builds upon the
			simultaneous <i>GPlates 0.9.5</i> &ldquo;stable&rdquo; release, adding the
			following advanced extension functionality:
			</p>

			<ul>

			<li>
			<strong>continuously-closing plates</strong>, utilising the new
			<strong>topological geometry</strong> functionality for the construction of
			time-varying topological plate-boundary polygons
			</li>

			<li>
			the calculation of <strong>lithosphere velocity fields</strong>, utilising the
			calculation of plate-motion velocities at CitComS mesh-node locations
			</li>

			<li>
			velocity-field <strong>arrow decorations</strong> &mdash; which are
			zoom-dependent, so that both the size of the arrows and the visual density of
			the arrows (i.e., the number of arrows drawn on the visible area of the surface
			of the Earth) scale automatically with zoom
			</li>

			<li>
			the new <strong>Topology Sections table</strong> which displays, and enables
			tabular editing of, topologies
			</li>

			<li>
			automated generation and export of velocity fields as GML DataBlock instances
			</li>

			</ul>

			Changes since 0.9.3:
			</p>
			 
			<ul>

			<li>
			The transition to the CMake build system has been completed.  This new build
			system replaces both the Autoconf/Automake/Libtool-based build system for Linux
			and the project files for the MS Visual Studio compilers, in addition to
			enabling compilation on MacOS X.
			</li>

			<li>
			GPlates now compiles and runs on the three main desktop operating systems: 
			Windows, Linux and MacOS X.
			</li>

			<li>
			It is now possible to manipulate geometries interactively, dragging vertices
			using the new Move Vertex tool.  This tool can be used on both existing feature
			geometries, as well as geometries which are in the process of being digitised.
			When the tool has been selected, the selected geometry will be drawn in grey,
			while its vertices will be highlighted and draggable.
			</li>

			<li>
			Previously, a raster image would always be shown by GPlates to cover the whole
			globe, from -180 to +180 degrees longitude and -90 to +90 latitude.  It's now
			possible to specify a surface extent of any longitude and latitude range for
			the raster, enabling rasters of a smaller size to be correctly sized and
			positioned.
			</li>

			<li>
			The Manage Feature Collections dialog offers the ability to reload a file from
			disk with a single click, as well as the ability to enable or disable a feature
			collection without unloading or reloading the file.
			</li>

			<li>
			It is now possible to save feature collections in GMT format, with a choice of
			header formats: PLATES4 line header; GPGIM feature properties; or a mixture of
			the two.  It's also possible to export a digitised geometry in GMT format (it
			was already possible to export a digitised geometry in PLATES4 line-format)
			during the digitisation process, without needing to create a whole new feature.
			</li>

			<li>
			Shapefile attributes may now be edited in the Feature Properties dialog in the
			same way as native GPGIM property-values.
			</li>

			<li>
			The Task Panel can now be resized in the main window, enabling text fields to
			be widened in order to display longer lines of text.
			</li>

			<li>
			All the attributes in a Shapefile may additionally be viewed in a more compact
			tabular (spreadsheet-like) format, with one attribute per column.
			</li>

			Changes since 0.9.2:
			</p>
			 
			<ul>

			<li>
			It is now possible to digitise new feature geometries using the point, polyline
			and polygon digitisation tools.  After a feature geometry has been digitised,
			an easy-to-use wizard is provided for the creation of a feature, enabling the
			user to specify the basic properties of the feature such as plate ID, time of
			existence and name, as well as the feature collection into which the new
			feature should be placed.
			</li>

			<li>
			The new Modify Reconstruction Pole tool enables the interactive modification of
			the Total Reconstruction Poles which define a reconstruction.  The user may
			drag the geometries of a plate around the globe to modify the Total
			Reconstruction Pole which reconstructs that plate.  When the user is happy with
			the new position of the plate, he or she may click the &ldquo;Apply&rdquo;
			button to cause a dialog box to appear which lists the calculated finite
			rotations for review; if the user then clicks the &ldquo;OK&rdquo; button, a
			new Total Reconstruction Pole will be inserted automatically into the loaded
			rotation file at the appropriate reconstruction time.
			</li>

			<li>
			When a feature geometry is focused or a new feature geometry is being
			digitised, the geometry will be highlighted in white.  When a geometry is
			dragged around the globe, its position will be updated in real time in grey.
			</li>

			<li>
			The Task Panel is a new user interface element in the main window which
			provides status information about whichever feature-interaction tool is
			currently active.  Depending upon which tool is active, this information
			consists of: a summary of the feature (when the Choose Feature tool is active);
			a listing of the coordinates which have been digitised so far (when one of the
			digitisation tools is active); or the adjustment by which the Total
			Reconstruction Pole has been modified (when the Modify Reconstruction Pole tool
			is active).
			</li>

			<li>
			It is now possible to choose between different feature-colouring schemes (by
			feature-type, by feature age or by a single user-specified colour), in addition
			to the existing colouring by plate ID.
			</li>

			<li>
			The long-awaited GPML reader is now operational!  This reader is able to read
			all reconstructable feature-types and reconstruction feature-types (Total
			Reconstruction Poles and Absolute Reference Frames) defined in the GPGIM 1.6
			specification.  <a href="gpml.html" title="Learn about GPML">GPML</a>, the
			GPlates Markup Language, is the GML-based &ldquo;native&rdquo; file format of
			GPlates.
			</li>

			<li>
			The XML-conformance of GPML input, output and in-memory storage has been
			improved, to ensure GPlates handles XML namespaces correctly.
			</li>

			<li>
			GPML may be compressed or uncompressed as it is being written to file or read
			from disk, using the freely-available free software program GZip.  GZipped GPML
			files can be up to 30 times smaller than uncompressed files!
			</li>

			<li>
			It is now possible to encode a variety of Shapefile attribute-types, with
			arbitrary attribute-names, in GPML.
			</li>

			<li>
			The internal geometry types, reconstruction mechanism and display graphics have
			been overhauled to enable GPlates to handle and display polygons and
			multi-geometries, as well as store duplicate vertices in polylines and
			polygons.
			</li>

			<li>
			Geometric property-values may now be edited in the Feature Properties dialog in
			the same easy-to-use fashion as non-geometric property-values.
			</li>

			</ul>

			<p>
			The GPlates 0.9.3.1 release is a minor bugfix to GPlates 0.9.3, to fix a bug in
			the mapping of Shapefile attributes which was noticed after GPlates 0.9.3 was
			uploaded, but before any release announcement had been made.  There are no
			other changes from 0.9.3.

			Changes since 0.9.1:
			</p>
			 
			<ul>

			<li>
			In addition to reconstructable features with point- and polyline-geometries,
			GPlates 0.9.2 is able to display raster images on the globe. These images can
			represent any kind of imagery or gridded data which covers the whole globe
			(with the image spanning the longitude range of -180 degrees to +180 degrees,
			and the latitude range of -90 to +90). GPlates is able to read raster images in
			the widely-used JPEG image format; once a raster is loaded, it is displayed as
			an OpenGL texture, enabling GPlates to remain responsive when the globe is
			rotated or the zoom is changed. (Currently, raster images are not reconstructed
			by GPlates.)
			</li>
			 
			<li>
			GPlates is able to display time-dependent global raster images. The user can
			instruct GPlates to load a sequence of JPEG image files contained in a folder
			(each image in the sequence corresponding to a particular instant in geological
			time) and GPlates will display the appropriate image on the globe for the
			current reconstruction time. As the user changes the reconstruction time, the
			raster image on the globe will update accordingly.
			</li>
			 
			<li>
			The Query Feature Properties dialog has been extended to enable the editing of
			GPGIM feature properties in an easy-to-use fashion (using a variety of
			custom-designed user-interface widgets for the various property types). Thus,
			GPlates now makes the transition from pure visualisation to editing as well. In
			addition, the reconstructed geometries of a feature can be displayed in
			parallel with the present-day geometries that are stored in data files.
			</li>
			 
			<li>
			Enhanced synchronisation between the user-interface elements which display the
			properties of GPGIM features means that when a property is changed, the program
			will react instantly to update the presentation of the feature &mdash; whether
			the changed property was a text field (which will be updated in the "Clicked"
			feature table), the time-period of existence of the feature (which may cause
			the feature to appear or disappear at the current reconstruction time) or the
			reconstruction plate ID (which may cause the feature to change colour and move
			to a different reconstructed position).
			</li>
			 
			<li>
			The new Total Reconstruction Poles dialog provides a variety of informative
			representations of the total reconstruction poles (finite rotations) for the
			current reconstruction time: tables of the relative and equivalent finite
			rotations for each plate ID in the hierarchy; a tree-like representation of the
			hierarchy of relative rotations; and the circuit between any plate and the
			user-specified stationary plate. This dialog also enables the export of the
			tables of finite rotations in CSV (comma-separated value) format.
			</li>
			 
			<li>
			The ability to map attributes in a Shapefile to GPlates Model properties on a
			per-Shapefile basis enables local Shapefile attribute-naming conventions to be
			integrated seamlessly into GPlates usage. The user-specified mappings will be
			saved to disk automatically, enabling GPlates to remember mappings between
			sessions. The attributes can be mapped to different properties at any time.
			</li>
